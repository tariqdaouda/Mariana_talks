# Talks about [Mariana (The Cutest Deep Learning Framework)](https://github.com/tariqdaouda/Mariana)
This repository contains the slides as well as the live coding examples and any other material used during the presentations.
Please keep in mind that I won't update the live coding examples with every new iteration of Mariana, thus some minor syntactical differences might cause them crash. However the Mariana language is very stable at this point and the general outlines should remain relevant.
For up to date examples please check the [examples on Mariana's repo](https://github.com/tariqdaouda/Mariana/tree/master/Mariana/examples).

Thanks for your interest in Mariana, star it if you like it!

Cheers,

Tariq
